# Main Body Assembly

The body is the housing of all the electronics for the rover. It is the attachment points for the rocker-bogie systems, as well as the differential pivot system.

## 1. Features

* Gives passthrough connections for USB ports on Raspberry Pi
* Cutouts on the rear of the body give access for voltage monitor and battery for charging
* Easy attachment point for differential pivot system
* Uses Actobotics parts to facilitate modularity and ability to change, and add new components easily.

## 3. Machining/Fabrication

### 3.1 9x12 Aluminum Plate Drilling

**Note: ServoCity has discontinued the 12x9 aluminum plates. Designs for replacement plates are available in the *[laser\_cut\_parts](laser_cut_parts/)* directory. If you need to use the laser cut parts, read the information found in [laser cut parts/README.md](laser_cut_parts/README.md) and then skip to section 3.2 of this document. The laser cut replacements have the necessary holes.**

First we need to drill a hole in one of the 9x12 Aluminum plates **S35** because we will need a hole of just over 0.5 in diameter for the differential pivot mount. There is already a small hole drilled in the location we want to use, but it needs to be widened substantially. Start with the drill #23 and drill the hole shown by Figure 1. Repeat this with drill sizes stepping up until you get to a drill of 0.5 in.

Take the 0.5 in hollow rod **S19** and make sure it spins freely in the hole you have created. If it does not, drill the hole slightly larger or sand/file the hole until the rod spins with no resistance (The 0.5 in hollow rod must spin *freely* while mounted inside the bearing blocks. See step 2.2 Differential pivot for example. It may help to follow step 2.2 in this document to test if you have enough clearance)

### 3.2 Laser Cut Parts

The front and back panel of the rover are designed to be made from laser cut acrylic, as to keep them modular to design different things to mount there as wanted. The 2D cutout files  are the .DXF files  and can be found on the github under Mechanical - Body Assembly - Laser Cut Parts

If you do not have access to a lases cutter there is an online service which you can order these from below: <https://www.sculpteo.com>

To get the above parts from Sculpteo, go to Laser cutting and then upload these files (with mm selected as units). Hit Next. Make sure scale is set to 100%, change the material to Acrylic, have thickness to 1/8 inch, and then select whatever color you wish.

## 4. Mechanical/Structural Assembly

**DISCLAIMER** All images were created using CAD that has #6-32 Socket head cap screws, but the parts list calls for button head screws. The button head screws are correct.

#### 4.1.3 Assemble the PVC clamping hub

* Insert the #6-32 Heat Set Inserts **I2** into the 3D-printed clamping hub **S50** in the locations shown in Figure 6. The inserts on the side of the clamp should go in from the left side as shown in Figure 4.
* Using washers **W1**, insert screws **B4** into clamp part of the clamping hub and screw part of the way into the brass inserts. Inserting these screws now simplifies inserting the PVC pipe later.

### 4.2 Differential Pivot Block

The differential pivot is used to transfer weight off of the wheel that is currently climbing to the other front wheel, allowing the rover to climb more easily. Additionally, it serves as a second contact point for the roverâ€™s body such that it does not rotate freely about the cross rod.
