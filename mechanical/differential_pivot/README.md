# Differential Pivot

The Differential Pivot helps to offload forces from one side of the rover to the other while climbing. The differential pivot is crucial in the rocker-bogie suspension system and is designed to help keep all 6 wheels on the ground at all times. It also allows a second attachment point for the body so that it does not freely rotate about the center bar that runs through it and connects the two sides of the rocker-bogie.

1. Take the 3 foot piece of 0.5 inch aluminum rod **S16** and cut it into one 15 inch piece and one 13.5 inch piece. These will now be referred to as the parts **S16A** and **S16B** respectively. In addition, take two of the 4 inch aluminum rods **S18** and cut them down to 3 inches in length as well.

The turnbuckles must be attached to the differential pivot and rocker-bogie arm. We will accomplish this by drilling holes in the aluminum beam S16B and attaching two 5-hole aluminum bars on each side.

### 3.2.1 Hole drilling  

Using a vice or clamp, firmly grab onto the 0.5 x 13.5 inch rod **S16B** with the end extending out around 2 inches from the edge of the vice/clamp. Mark the dimensions as shown in Figure 3. Carefully use a center drill to start the a center hole for these holes. It is important that the center hole is as centered as possible to prevent the bit from walk- ing/slipping during drilling, which could result in the bit breaking. Then, use a #23 (0.154 inch diameter) drill bit and drill all the way through both sides of the rod. This makes the **S16B** part.

### 3.2.2 Test fit

Test the holes by taking the 5 Hole Aluminum Beams S21 and screws B7 and making sure that the screws go all the way through as shown in Figure 4. If they do not fit, you can Figure 3: Testing the differential pivot holes Flip the rod around and repeat the steps for the other side, making sure to align the holes’ axes as much as possible such that the holes are all parallel to the previous set.

### 3.2.3 Hole drilling

Next, take two of the 0.5x3 inch hollow rods **S18** and create the same set of holes as before, showed again in Figure 5 (this time, drill holes on just one end of each of the rods). Test each of the sets of holes to make sure the 5-hole aluminum beams will attach to each of the rods. These will now be the part **S18B**.

### 4.1 Build the Differential pivot block

### 4.1.1 Build clamping hub assembly

Attach the the bottom bore clamping hubs **S20** to the single pattern bracket **S8** using screws **B1**. Then mount the 0.5” clamping hub **S13** to the bottom of this assembly using **B1** screws.

### 4.1.2 Differential Pivot

Attach the turnbuckle **S32** to the modified 13.5-inch aluminum rod **S16B** as shown using the 5-hole aluminum bars **S21**, washers **W2**, screws **B7** and **B9**, hex nuts **B11** and **B12**. The outermost screw is the #4 screw, the others are #6.

### 4.1.3 Differential Pivot continued

Pass the 13.5inch rod through the clamping hub assembly, making sure to center it as much as possible. Then repeat step 2 for the other side of the differential pivot. If necessary, unscrew the turnbuckles (by twisting the middle) to insert the rods into place, then screw the turnbuckle back together.
