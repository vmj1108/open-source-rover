# Rocker-Bogie Suspension

The Rocker-Bogie is the suspension system that enables the rover to climb aggressive obstacles. The design allows all 6 wheels to be in contact with the ground as much as possible, increasing traction.  The suspension system on a typical consumer vehicle can traverse obstacles about half the height of one wheel; the Rocker-Bogie suspension system can traverse obstacles over 2 times the height of the wheel.

## 1. Features

* Modular link lengths give the ability to customize rover geometry
* Optimized for climbing in the forwards direction
* Rigid support structure resists lateral bending/twisting about the Bogie joint

### 3.1 Cutting the Aluminum Channels

On piece **S2**, measure the distance shown in Figure 1 from the edge and mark a straight line from the opposite corner to that point. Cut off the corner along that line. We use this piece to make the geometry of the rocker-bogie more structurally reinforced across its lateral bending moment. However, these channels will need to have their corners cut out because of clearance issues further on. In total, you will need 4 of these modified pieces. Cut those now.

### 3.2 Cutting the Aluminum Rod

Take the 4 inch aluminum rod **S18** and cut it down to 3 inches long, indicated by Figure 2. These cuts keep the rod from sticking out too far from either end of the rocker-bogie pivot joint. In total, you will need 2 of these 3-inch aluminum rods. Cut those now.

## 4. Mechanical/structural Assembly

The Rocker-Bogie assembly is what attaches your wheels to the rover's body and allows it to climb over obstacles.

### 4.1 Begin the Rocker Attachment

Attach 9 inch channel **S5** and the a modified 3 inch channel **S2A** to pattern F bracket **S7** using screws **B2** and hex nuts **B11** making sure to put a 6-32 washer **W1** in between the channels and the bracket. Make sure that the cut modification in **S2A** is angled towards the 9 inch channel as shown in Figure 4.
