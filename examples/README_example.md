# Main Body Assembly

The body is the housing of all the electronics for the rover. It is the attachment points for the rocker-bogie systems, as well as the differential pivot system.

## 1. Features

* Gives passthrough connections for USB ports on Raspberry Pi
* Cutouts on the rear of the body give access for voltage monitor and battery for charging
* Really pretty

### 3.1 9x12 Aluminum Plate Drilling

First we need to drill a hole in one of the 9x12 Aluminum plates **S35** because we will need a hole of just over 0.5 in diameter for the differential pivot mount. There is already a small hole drilled in the location we want to use, but it needs to be widened substantially. Start with the drill #23 and drill the hole shown by Figure 1. Repeat this with drill sizes stepping up until you get to a drill of 0.5 in.
